# Install and config scripts

Made for personal use and really simple

There is two directories so far, `0-ArchInstall` and `1-PostInstall`

In `0-ArchInstall` we have a script to use in Arch Linux installer

In `1-PostInstall` there is almost all the configs to make the system run as I like

Is pretty much it...

Good studies :)
